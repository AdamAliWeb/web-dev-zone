# JavaScript Compilation

## Introduction

After mastering the fundamentals of web programming (**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**), it's time to explore the tools and technologies that can accelerate your web development journey. However, before diving into these tools, it's essential to grasp some basic concepts to effectively apply them.

## Tutorial

### npm

**npm** (Node Package Manager) is a crucial tool for managing packages in **Node.js**. It allows you to execute **JavaScript** not only in web browsers but also on desktop systems and web servers.

This package manager simplifies the automatic installation and maintenance of **JavaScript** (for both **Node.js** and web browsers) in projects.

To get started, install **Node.js**, the compiler that enables you to run **JavaScript** on your computer. Once installed, **npm** will be readily available for use.

For a detailed guide on **Node.js**, **npm**, and managing dependencies, consider watching these informative videos:

### Compilation Tools

Compilation tools bundle modules, creating a single file containing all necessary modules for your application. They enhance functionalities, speed up development, and facilitate language conversion. For example, you can consolidate **JavaScript** files and style files into one. While various tools are available, they range from simpler and limited to more complex and flexible ones. Watch this introductory video to understand these tools better: **[Module Bundlers Explained... Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and Snowpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IG4UmULyoA)**.

Understanding these tools will be more beneficial when connected with the next section. However, it's wise to familiarize yourself with them and choose the one that suits you best.

-   **Webpack**: A module bundler that generates a single file containing all necessary modules for your application. It enables you to manage dependencies and perform tasks like code optimization. While complex to use, it offers high customization and flexibility.

I personally prefer using the **Vite** tool for its lightweight, simplicity, and speed, but choose based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

You now have the knowledge to compile code for web use. However, this is just the beginning, as the next section explores **JavaScript** frameworks, an extensive topic. Stay prepared!
