# Interview Preparation

## Introduction

This section is entirely dedicated to helping those who want to seek a job as a _Front-end_ developer. With that clarified, I'll show you the resources and topics to learn and practice to increase your chances of finding a job. But always remember that there is a considerable luck factor, so regardless of your level, you must be consistent and keep applying and practicing.

As the position of a _Front-end_ developer, knowledge of algorithms and design systems is not as necessary. However, if your goal is to seek a _Full-stack_ position, you will need knowledge of these concepts.

Let me emphasize that you should primarily focus on being good at _Front-end_, as many people try to cover _Full-stack_ from the beginning, which often prevents them from honing their skills in specific aspects.

## Tutorial

### Projects

You'll start by planning what you'll do each day to improve and get a job. First things first: if you don't have studies or certificates in web development, you'll need to create related projects to demonstrate your experience and knowledge. The process from start to finish on how to organize that project or projects is already extensively explained in the web procedure section. Therefore, I'll assume you already have a project ready to demonstrate your experience. If you still don't have a clear idea for your project, here is a guide of possible applications you can make. Try to recreate them and add an original function or a small detail:

### Portfolio

Next, I recommend starting to build your portfolio to showcase your projects and as a method of contact. Try to make it as personal as possible. Think of it as your personal website, but one that has to be well programmed. As for the portfolio, there are countless tutorials on **YouTube** and the basics it should have are the presentation, experience or projects, and contact sections. Additionally, it would be good if you include the technologies or tools used in the projects and keep it concise, as those who look for employees see many portfolios and a short and simple one can be a key point to getting an interview.

### Coding

Once this is done, it's time to prepare for the interviews themselves. First, we'll prepare our programming logic. Many interviews will require you to solve logic problems, and you'll need to be ready to solve them. Dedicate a certain amount of daily time to solving them. If you can't solve an exercise within 30 minutes to 1 hour, move on to the next one. I also recommend taking several exercises you have done and trying to solve them as quickly as possible and timing yourself. By doing this with different sets of exercises, you'll prepare for quickly solving problems and have fewer issues during the interview. Here are several pages to practice these types of questions:

-   **[Exercism JavaScript](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises)**

-   **[GreatFrontEnd Coding](https://www.greatfrontend.com/prepare/coding)**

-   **[LeetCode Exercises](https://leetcode.com/problemset)**

### Quiz

Here is a table with the most asked topics for each technology, so you can prepare adequately:

Additionally, I offer several pages with quiz-type questions to prepare for the interview and answer them quickly and concisely. The best way is to simulate answering them aloud to practice as much as possible; you can record yourself or not, so you can see how you responded and if you need to practice more:

-   **[GreatFrontEnd Quiz](https://www.greatfrontend.com/prepare/quiz)**

-   **[GreatFrontEnd Behavioral Questions](https://www.greatfrontend.com/behavioral-interview-guidebook)**

-   **[React JS Int. Questions](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/reactjs-interview-questions)**

### Application

There are different pages to apply online. I recommend you look for the most typical ones and those used in your area and apply there. Another option would be to look for tech companies in your area and try to apply there or get to know people from there. One of the best things you can do is see where tech meetups are happening near you and go meet people, see where there are job opportunities, and learn more from experienced people. This way of getting a job is called "referrals" and is one of the most likely to succeed.

## Conclusion

After using these resources and tips, I hope you can strive and find that _Front-End_ developer job. These steps don't guarantee you'll get a job instantly, and it also depends on what you're looking for. If you plan to be a freelancer, you'll need to refine the part of getting clients, negotiation, customer service, and other aspects. But for a common _Front-End_ developer position, all this information should be complete and useful. I would like you to send me a message on one of my networks and tell me how this website has helped you and how long it took you to find a job after using all the information I have provided. That way, I can know how many people it has helped and what I need to improve.
