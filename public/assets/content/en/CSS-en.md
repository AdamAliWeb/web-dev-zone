# CSS

## Introduction

**CSS**, short for _Cascading Style Sheets_, is a language used to design and style websites, controlling their appearance for users. It complements **HTML**, which manages the core content of web pages.

The term "cascading" is used because **CSS** statements are processed from top to bottom, creating a cascading effect.

With **CSS**, you can establish rules that instruct your website on how to present content, such as typography, colors, and sizes. The current version of **CSS** is **CSS3**.

## Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices

-   For real-world printing of web pages, consider using a media query to customize styles and **HTML** content specifically for printing. You can learn how to do this here: **[Print Styles: CSS Tutorial (Day 6 of CSS3 in 30 Days)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAgLAeykOyU)**.

-   Common breakpoints for device resolutions are as follows:

    | Screen Sizes | Scope                                                                                                 |
    | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 320px        | Devices with small screens, like phones, in vertical mode.                                            |
    | 480px        | Devices with small screens, like phones, in horizontal mode.                                          |
    | 600px        | Small tablets, like the Amazon Kindle (600x800) and Barnes & Noble Nook (600x1024), in vertical mode. |
    | 768px        | 10-inch tablets like the iPad (768x1024), in vertical mode.                                           |
    | 1024px       | Tablets like the iPad (1024x768), in horizontal mode, and some laptop, netbook, and desktop screens.  |
    | 1200px       | Panoramic screens, mostly laptops and PCs.                                                            |

-   When using media queries, it's recommended to use the `min-width` and `max-height` properties with `ems` rather than pixels. Pixels are considered absolute units, but in reality, they are relative to the screen's resolution. If a device has a higher density, the proportion of the pixels changes. That's why it's important to express the breakpoints of media queries in `ems`, which are relative and proportional units. For example, `320px / 16px = 20em`.

    | PX     | EM     |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | 320px  | 20em   |
    | 480px  | 30em   |
    | 600px  | 37.5em |
    | 768px  | 48em   |
    | 1024px | 64em   |
    | 1200px | 75em   |

-   Resetting the `box-sizing` property to `border-box` in **CSS** ensures that an element's total size includes padding and border, simplifying design and avoiding unexpected overflows. It also integrates well with **CSS** frameworks and libraries:

    ```css
    *,
    *:before,
    *:after {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    ```

-   In web development, it's advisable to apply styles to classes rather than IDs. This allows for style reuse, simplifies maintenance by centralizing changes, avoids specificity conflicts, maintains a clear separation between structure and design, aligns with community standards, and offers greater flexibility in collaboration and scalability for large projects:

    ```css
    /* BAD */
    #element {
        padding: 2rem;
    }

    /* GOOD */
    .element {
        padding: 2rem;
    }
    ```

-   The correct order of link pseudo-classes is:

    1. **:link**
    2. **:hover**
    3. **:active**
    4. **:visited**

-   Restrict the use of one color system in the current project to maintain a more organized color structure.

-   To extract color codes from images or programs on your computer, you can use this application: **[HTML Color Picker](https://download.cnet.com/quick-html-color-picker/3001-2192_4-10400979.html)**.

-   In **Visual Studio Code**, you can change the color system of a color by hovering the cursor on the color chart and clicking the value at the top of the chart. This value will change with each click.

-   **Chrome DevTools** has a function called CSS Overview that allows you to visualize all the styles of a website, including colors, fonts, and media queries. You can find a detailed guide about how to use it here: **[CSS Overview: Identify potential CSS improvements](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css-overview/)**.

-   Sometimes, when scrolling or navigating to a certain section of your page, the header at the top can hide some elements at the beginning of the section. To fix this, you can assign a margin to that section when the user is there. Use the `scroll-margin-top` property and set the value of the margin you'd like to apply. Here is an example: **[scroll-margin-top - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin-top)**.

-   Use logical properties like `inline` and `block`. Since not all languages follow the left-to-right direction of English, it's crucial to have an adaptable writing experience. Logical properties provide better support for languages written in horizontal (_like Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu) or vertical direction (like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean_). They are also shorter and simpler to write:

    ```css
    /* BAD */
    .element {
        margin-left: 2rem;
        margin-right: 2rem;
    }

    /* GOOD */
    .element {
        margin-inline: 2rem;
    }
    ```

-   Remember that if a child element has the `width` property in percentages, the parent will automatically occupy 100% of the available space. It's important to control this effect.

-   Avoid using abbreviated declarations unless you need to set all available values (like `background`, `font`, etc.). The overuse of abbreviated properties can lead to disorganized code with unnecessary overrides and unintended side effects:

    ```css
    /* BAD */
    .element {
        background: red;
    }

    /* GOOD */
    .element {
        background-color: red;
    }
    ```

-   Avoid `@import` since it can slow down loading, add additional requests, and generate unexpected issues. It's better to import stylesheets using `<link>` in HTML or using preprocessors.

-   To improve readability, follow an ordered structure when declaring **CSS** properties. You can find the suggested order here: **[CSS property order | @mdo](https://markdotto.com/2011/11/29/css-property-order/)**.

-   To make all multimedia on your page flexible and adaptive to screen size, use this **CSS** declaration (though there are other ways to do it):

    ```css
    img,
    audio,
    video,
    iframe,
    canvas,
    svg,
    picture {
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }
    ```

-   Avoid using the viewport measure to establish a width of `100vw` in elements, since this will cause horizontal overflows, problems on small devices, and unexpected results in design. It's better to opt for using relative measures like percentages, `em's`, or `rem's`.

-   **Desktop First** and **Mobile First** are the 2 main strategies in responsive design to adapt content to screen size. **Mobile First** focuses on small screens, while **Desktop First** prioritizes larger screens. In responsive design, it's better to use **Mobile First** because it prioritizes the experience on small devices, enhancing loading speed and usability on small screens. Then, you can progressively expand the design for larger screens, resulting in effective and efficient adaptability.
