# Welcome to WebDevZone

This page is a comprehensive collection of tutorials and resources focused on web development, hence the title, **WebDevZone**. All the content is written in **Markdown** format, so this project also serves as a _**Markdown** Previewer_.

All resources include tutorials, tools, and tips that are completely free and public. I have not created them, nor do they belong to me. The idea is to have them all in one organized place to save time searching.

If you prefer to get information from other sources because they are more documented, you want another alternative, or for any other reason, you can do so. This is not a definitive guide. I am also learning on my own and trying to find work in this field that I am passionate about. This project is designed to help myself and those who don't know which path to follow or who prefer to have everything in one place.

I try to update **WebDevZone** constantly to make it more complete, have more content, and stay aligned with current standards. Currently, this is the second version of **WebDevZone**, and I believe it will remain so for some time. However, I will make small updates periodically.

Now, without further delay, I hope this website is useful to you and helps you in your goals. If you don't know how to proceed, press the button with three lines to access the menu and navigate through the sections. Good luck and have a great day!
