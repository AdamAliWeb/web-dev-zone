# TypeScript

## Introduction

**TypeScript** is a programming language that adds certain rules and new features to **JavaScript**. **JavaScript**, being a weakly typed language, does not perform strict checks on values when declaring variables or parameters. In **JavaScript**, you can add two values of different types, such as a string and a number, which in other languages would require converting one of the variables to the type of the other. This can lead to conversion errors and errors when operating with inappropriate values.

**JavaScript** was designed this way because, in its early days, it was not conceived as a full-fledged programming language but as a simple language to add functionality to websites. Over time, **JavaScript** began to be used on the backend with **Node.js** and in other areas thanks to compilers, libraries, and tools. However, **JavaScript** generated some errors and issues that were not present in other languages due to its weak typing.

Therefore, in 2012, Anders Hejlsberg created **TypeScript** to address these shortcomings of **JavaScript**. Today, **TypeScript** is increasingly used in the frontend and is becoming more in demand in the job market, as it offers greater security, even though it requires writing more code. Before we continue, let's clarify two important points:

1. **TypeScript** does not run in real-time; it must be compiled each time changes are applied, and many of its validations do not block the execution of **JavaScript**.
2. **TypeScript** is not mandatory. While it is beneficial to know and use, and it can open more job opportunities, it also has disadvantages such as the need for constant compilation and writing more code. However, in large projects, its use is highly recommended.

## Conclusion

Although this section is short, it is quite useful, and I hope you have understood its purpose. If you have already learned another object-oriented language like **C#** or **Java**, learning **TypeScript** will be easier and more intuitive for you. There is still content to be added for the resources and tips sections. I will try to add it in the future.
