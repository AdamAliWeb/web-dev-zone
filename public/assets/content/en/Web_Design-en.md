# Web Design

## Introduction

Although this website is more oriented towards frontend programming than design, both are closely related, much like the frontend and backend. If you're planning to create projects or build your own websites, you need to have notions of web design so that your page looks good, is pleasant to use, and stands out. That's why I've included this section as an additional resource. Although it's not mandatory for frontend development, I consider it very important and useful. In my opinion, frontend is more related to web design than to backend. This depends on your circumstances, and you can choose the path you prefer.

Design is more flexible, and everyone has the freedom to do it their way. Still, there are principles to follow to make the pages more attractive and offer a good user experience.

## Tutorial

### Report

Before designing any interface, you should write a small brief about what you are going to do and for whom. You should already have the content of the page and its sections indicated, as well as the purpose of the page, its features, and its target audience. This will help you focus better on the design. I recommend this do it directly in **Figma** to have it handy.

### Wireframes

After having a clear understanding of the basics of the webpage, start creating wireframes. These will help you build the structure of the page and focus on its positioning and user experience. Here you don't need to worry about fonts or colors, as it will only serve as a guide for the main structure.

### Colors

The next step is to choose the color palette for your website. Each color expresses a feeling or an aesthetic and affects the user's experience. To choose the palette, there are several methods and tools. Here are some websites where you can customize palettes and see recommendations:

-   **[Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/es/create/color-wheel)**

-   **[ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/)**

-   **[Muzli](https://colors.muz.li/)**

-   **[Web Gradients](https://webgradients.com/)**

-   **[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/)**

### Typography

The last step before designing is choosing the font, the typography. This can be very difficult and crucial, so you'll have to try different options until you find the right one. The best way to do this is using **[Typescale](https://typescale.com/)**, a tool that allows you to visualize different types of fonts and their sizes.

There are mainly two types of fonts: serif and sans-serif. Serif fonts have a kind of tail on each letter, while sans-serif fonts have a firm ending. Serif fonts are more commonly used on fashion or clothing websites as they give a sense of elegance. Sans-serif fonts are mainly used on technology-related websites as they give a sense of modernity.

You can get fonts for free from **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**. Don't use too many types of fonts, as it will affect the page loading time and create more rendering issues. Try to keep it between 1 and 3 fonts if possible.

After these steps, proceed to make the final design, following the wireframes and adding the colors and fonts. The wireframe is just a guide; you don't have to follow it 100%. I recommend not spending too much time constructing the wireframes, as many things can change when designing.

## Conclusion

Although this section is extra and not necessary, I consider it very important as it will give you insights into how to build the appearance of your web pages appropriately. An example of this would be **WebDevZone**. The page worked well, but it had multiple design issues that made it difficult to use. Considering that most of the time users are reading, creating a pleasant view is key. That's why I focused more on the aspect of web design and was able to improve the appearance of my projects, including this one.
