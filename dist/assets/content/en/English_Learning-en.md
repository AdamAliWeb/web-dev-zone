# English Learning

## Introduction

English is one of the most spoken and widespread languages globally, serving as a standard. Its impact on programming is nearly absolute, and there's practically no way to code without knowing some English. If you already have a good base English knowledge you can skip this entire section.

In the programming world, it's crucial to know it. Understanding English better helps you comprehend certain topics and learn more. For instance, since most documentation is written in English, not knowing it can severely limit you. Additionally, English proficiency is often required when job hunting, as many jobs involve working with people from around the world. Therefore, English proficiency is often necessary.

Many people find it challenging to learn English because they lack consistency or use incorrect learning methods. For many, learning a language doesn't mean memorizing grammar and rules. While studying grammar can help, it's not valid for everyone. Thus, I'm here to share methods that can facilitate learning and make it enjoyable.

It consists of five parts:

-   Basic

-   Reading

-   Listening

-   Speaking

-   Writing

These sections range from the simplest to the most complex, with writing being the most challenging, in my opinion. So, without further ado, let's get started.

## Basic

When starting out, take it easy and go slowly to avoid feeling overwhelmed by not understanding anything. I recommend starting with apps like **Duolingo** and similar ones, along with **YouTube** tutorials. Dedicate some time each day to this, depending on how much time you're willing to invest. For example, spend 15 minutes to an hour daily on **Duolingo**. If consistency is challenging, set a specific time when you're not busy to ensure you do it every day.

Also, dedicate more time, such as on weekends, to test your knowledge, plan your learning for the coming days, and explore new topics.

When you have to translate text you could use the artificial intelligence tool **[Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com)**. Just ask the chat to translate the text, paste the text and the chat would process a translated text.

## Reading

After spending some time learning the basics and testing yourself, it's time to read more and consume content. Start by reading English content, whether related to programming or not, that you previously read in Spanish. Also, watch videos, series, or movies in English with English subtitles.

It's crucial that the subtitles are in English, not Spanish, as this helps you connect written words with spoken words. It's okay not to understand everything; if you come across a word or phrase you don't understand, you can skip it.

It may be challenging, especially if you're trying to understand the plot of a movie or the purpose of a topic, but it won't be for long. If you find it difficult to understand most of the content, whether reading or watching, go back to basics and try again later.

## Listening

Here, you'll do almost the same as before but consume content without subtitles. This step is essential for creating a connection with what's being said. Subtitles act like a map, so you need to learn to do without them and orient yourself. Similarly, if you find that you don't understand most things, go back and try again later.

## Speaking

This part can be the most complicated because it sometimes depends on each person's situation. Basically, there are several ways to practice speaking. One of them is to find English natives and establish a bond with them, trying to speak with them regularly. You could also do this with non-native English speakers, but the impact and progression won't be the same. However, if it's easier for you, you can follow this method. Another alternative, which may be less effective but still quite useful as it's more accessible, is to consume content and, for each sentence, try to repeat what the people in the content are saying, imitating their pronunciation. I recommend listening to native English speakers, not accented ones, to polish your accent. After following this method, you can also speak with people to improve even more.

## Writing

This is the part where grammar is more involved, and you'll have to learn it to formulate sentences correctly. Here, I recommend studying grammar for a while and then simply trying to write anything and keep a record of it. If you find it hard to start writing, begin by keeping an English journal and learn a grammar aspect each day, then write about what you studied and what happened during the day in English in the journal.

Here I present you to a channel that I consider very good which would help you to master enough the grammatics:

## Conclusion

If you manage to master the last part, you'll have acquired a good level of English. If you're interested in expanding it further, you'll need to consume content with more complex vocabulary and study grammar more thoroughly, but it's not necessary for everyday use; it's more for people specializing in the language. Remember that this may take more or less time depending on how much time you dedicate daily and how efficient you are at language learning. Keep in mind that the latter is genetic, and effort and consistency pay off.
