# Internet

## Introduction

This guide offers quick and concise information about the Internet. It provides links to external articles for an in-depth understanding of how the Internet works and its ecosystem. Don't hesitate to explore the suggested articles for more detailed insights.

As a developer, having basic knowledge of the Internet is crucial, as it forms the foundation of most modern applications. To develop efficiently and at scale, understanding the fundamental concepts of Internet functioning is essential. The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that use standardized protocols to communicate. For a deeper understanding of how computers connect, refer to this article: **[How does the Internet work?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/How_does_the_Internet_work)**

## Tutorial

### Protocols

Protocols are necessary to ensure the smooth flow of data across different systems. Various protocols cater to different cases of data transfer.

In web development, the most important protocols are **HTTP** and **HTTPS**. **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) facilitates communication between the server and the client through hypertext, including text, multimedia files, and links to other files. When you visit a web page, your browser sends a request to the server, which responds with another **HTTP** request containing the page.

**HTTPS** (_**HTTP** Secure_) is a more secure version of **HTTP**, encrypting data between the client and the server using **SSL** and **TLS** encryption.

For a more extensive overview of Internet protocols, check out **[Types of Internet protocols](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-protocols/)**. Another article that delves deeper into the history and characteristics of the **HTTP** protocol is **[HTTP in depth](https://cs.fyi/guide/http-in-depth)**.

### Domains

Domains are unique, unchangeable names for websites, linked to an IP address stored on servers. **DNS** (Domain Name System) facilitates access to web pages, making it easier than memorizing pure IP addresses. Learn more about **DNS** with this relevant article: **[What is DNS?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)**.

### Hosting

Hosting is the web service that stores a website. Essentially, the domain is the name of the page, and hosting is where it's stored. There are various types and services of hosting. Get a clear explanation of hosting in this video: **[What Is Web Hosting? Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htbY9-yggB0)**.

### Web Browsers

A web browser is a program that allows you to view the information contained on a web page. The browser interprets the code, typically **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, in which the web page is written, and displays it on the screen, allowing the user to interact with its content and navigate.

It is crucial to consider the different browsers that users will use to access our pages. In theory, web standards published by the **W3C** should ensure that pages are displayed exactly the same in all browsers.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a general understanding of how the web works. While there are many aspects and nuances, delving into them would lead us to network development and other areas. The information here offers basic knowledge about how the Internet functions, what it does, and where websites are located.
