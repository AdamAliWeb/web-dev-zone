## Introduction\r
\r
**HTML** (_HyperText Markup Language_) is the markup language used to create websites. It's a standard language for defining the structure and content of a web page, including text, images, videos, forms, and more.\r
\r
Currently, it's in its fifth version (**HTML5**), which has introduced a host of new features compared to the early days of the internet.\r
\r
We'll also delve into **Emmet**. This handy extension for code editors accelerates the process of writing and editing various formats like **HTML**, **XML**, **XSL**, and more. Through content assistance, **Emmet** enables quick and efficient editing of **HTML** and **CSS** code using abbreviations.\r
\r
For website developers dealing with **HTML** files, a basic editor might not suffice. Especially for Front-end development, **Emmet** plays a crucial role in boosting productivity. This plugin employs short abbreviations to generate extensive **HTML** and **CSS** code structures, allowing for the swift creation of complex content. Although optional, **Emmet** can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency when working with **HTML** and **CSS** code.\r

## Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices\r
\r
-   When validating forms, don't rely only on the required attribute. Implement server-side validations for added security.\r
\r
-   Place \`<link>\` tags in your \`<head>\` section, preferably towards the end. Similarly, put \`<script>\` tags in your \`<body>\` section, also towards the end.\r
\r
    \`\`\`html\r
    <!DOCTYPE html>\r
    <html lang="en">\r
        <head>\r
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />\r
            <meta\r
                name="viewport"\r
                content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"\r
            />\r
            <title>Document</title>\r
            <!-- CSS Styles -->\r
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />\r
        </head>\r
        <body>\r
            <!-- JavaScript Code -->\r
            <script src="index.js"><\/script>\r
        </body>\r
    </html>\r
    \`\`\`\r
\r
-   If you use special characters like \`<, >, &, "\`, it's crucial to use specific shortcuts in your **HTML** code. This ensures they display correctly when using **JavaScript** or **PHP** code. Here are the expected shortcuts:\r
\r
    | Shortcuts | Symbols |\r
    | --------- | ------- |\r
    | \`&lt;\`    | <       |\r
    | \`&gt;\`    | >       |\r
    | \`&amp;\`   | &       |\r
    | \`&quot;\`  | "       |\r
\r
-   To optimize performance, restrict the use of the \`<iframe>\` tag to a maximum of two per page.\r
\r
-   For optimizing \`<iframe>\` tags from YouTube, you can use **https://tube.rvere.com/**. It loads the video only when clicked, improving page optimization. Replace the actual \`<iframe>\` code with the provided code.\r
\r
-   In an **HTML** document, there should be only one \`<h1>\` element.\r
\r
-   Avoid including styles or **JavaScript** code directly in your **HTML** content. Instead, write them in separate files for better organization.\r
\r
-   Provide a relevant value for the \`alt\` attribute in your images. This improves accessibility and search engine rankings.\r
\r
-   Include a canonical **URL** in the \`<head>\` section of your web page for improved search engine indexing:\r
\r
    \`\`\`html\r
    <link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/preferred-url-here/" />\r
    \`\`\`\r
\r
-   Use \`<em>\` for emphasizing text rather than \`<i>\`. \`<i>\` is now widely accepted for representing icons.\r
\r
-   To test your website on your phone, ensure it's connected to the same network as your computer. Type \`ipconfig\` in the terminal, find the **IPv4 Address**, and enter this IP address along with your server's port in your phone's browser. For example, \`192.168.0.230:5500\`. If this doesn't work, follow the instructions in this video: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRYHX4EwYYA**.\r
\r
-   Favicon functionality is limited to desktop browsers and not mobile devices. To enable favicons on mobile websites, add this additional tag to your \`<head>\` section: \`<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="img/favicon.png">\`.\r
\r
-   In general, it's preferred to use images in **SVG** or **WEBP** formats on your website instead of **PNG** or **JPG**. For an in-depth explanation, refer to this article: **https://ed.team/blog/que-imagenes-debes-usar-en-tu-web-jpg-png-svg-o-webp**\r
\r
-   Avoid excessive use of \`<div>\` tags. Instead, opt for semantic tags like \`<main>\`, \`<section>\`, \`<article>\`, and others for cleaner and more structured code:\r
\r
    \`\`\`html\r
    <!-- BAD -->\r
    <div>\r
        <div>\r
            <div>\r
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>\r
            </div>\r
        </div>\r
    </div>\r
\r
    <!-- GOOD -->\r
    <article>\r
        <section>\r
            <div>\r
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>\r
            </div>\r
        </section>\r
    </article>\r
    \`\`\`\r
\r
-   Always include the language tag \`<lang>\` in the \`<html>\` tag. This helps voice synthesis tools determine appropriate pronunciations and translation tools apply correct grammatical rules.\r
\r
-   The \`<title>\` tag is recommended to have between 55 and 65 characters, while the \`<meta name="description">\` tag should not exceed 165 characters for optimal page positioning.\r
\r
-   For better code readability, follow this attribute order for **HTML** elements:\r
\r
    1. class\r
    2. id, name\r
    3. data-\r
    4. src, for, type, href, value\r
    5. title, alt\r
    6. role, aria-\r
    7. tabindex\r
    8. style\r
\r
-   Use the attribute \`tabindex="0"\` to create interactive elements that can be navigated with the Tab key without changing the order of the tabulation.\r
\r
-   A boolean attribute is one that doesn't require a declared value. While **XHTML** demands a value declaration, **HTML5** does not.\r
\r
## Exercises and Projects\r
\r
Typically, exercises that involve both **HTML** and **CSS** are used for practice. However, here's a simple exercise to start with: **[Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app)**.\r
\r
## Conclusion\r
\r
That covers the basics of **HTML**. There are two more essential building blocks in web programming: **CSS** and **JavaScript**. You'll learn how to use them in their respective sections.\r
